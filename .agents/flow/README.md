# Flow

A lightweight product-development methodology for humans and AI coding agents.

Flow helps turn ideas, requirements, and existing software into small, verifiable increments—while keeping important decisions available across sessions.

## How it works

**Explore → Specify → Plan → Build → Review → Ship**

These are activities, not mandatory gates for every task.

A clear bug fix can move directly into implementation. A new product direction may need discovery, design, and explicit decisions before building.

## What Flow keeps connected

- **Product:** What we are building, for whom, and why.
- **Design:** How the experience should work and feel.
- **Architecture:** How the system is organized.
- **Execution:** Bounded tasks, delegated work, verification, and delivery.
- **Learning:** Evidence that informs the next decision.

The canonical product documents evolve as the product changes. Agents read the relevant context before acting and update it when meaningful decisions or implementations change.

## Flow and Flow Factory

**Flow** is the methodology and works independently of any particular technology stack.

**Flow Factory** is an opinionated implementation that combines Flow with a TypeScript development foundation, coding-agent tools, and evaluation infrastructure. See [factory.md](factory.md) for adoption and foundation navigation. Active Factory initiatives (for example [MCP discoverability](initiatives/mcp-discoverability.md)) live under [initiatives/](initiatives/).

## Start using Flow

You do not need to memorize commands. Describe the work you want to do and collaborate with your coding agent.

- [Working with Flow](guides/working-with-flow.md) — includes what you receive in a **Task report** after each task
- [Principles](guides/principles.md)
- [Project context and documentation](guides/project-context.md)
- [Influences and skills](guides/influences.md)
- [Learning and improvement](guides/improvement.md)

## Commands

Optional Cursor commands. Ordinary work does not load them. Canonical instructions are in `.agents/flow/skills/`.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`/flow`](skills/flow/SKILL.md) | Spec → Tasks → Build → Review → Ship |
| [`/f-council`](skills/f-council/SKILL.md) | Independent decision review |
| [`/f-retro`](skills/f-retro/SKILL.md) | Evidence-based workflow improvement |
| [`/f-extract`](skills/f-extract/SKILL.md) | Extract reusable starter capabilities |
| [`/f-yolo`](skills/f-yolo/SKILL.md) | Test, commit, push, deploy, verify |

For exact rules, see [Flow's operational contract](flow.md).
