# Local prompt log

Conversation trail for assessments, audits, and collaboration review. **Never commit** `.agents/flow/prompts.txt`. Repository-root `prompts.txt` is **gitignored by default**; an employer brief may require a **tracked** root log on a product branch (remove `prompts.txt` from `.gitignore` and commit the file there—never on `main` for assessment-only work).

Task closeout in chat still uses the [Task report](journal.md#task-report-user-visible).

## Automatic append (Cursor hooks)

When `.cursor/hooks.json` is present, project hooks append on every agent turn:

| Hook | Script | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `beforeSubmitPrompt` | `node .agents/tooling/prompt-log/append-on-stop.mjs submit` | Stash the human prompt for the current `generation_id` |
| `stop` | `node .agents/tooling/prompt-log/append-on-stop.mjs stop` | Append one block to `prompts.txt` (transcript + stash); dedupe by `generation_id` |

Hooks run only when `AGENTS.md` contains `## Local prompt log (enabled)`. They fail open (exit 0). The coordinator should still append or enrich the block when the hook summary is thin—hooks are the floor, not a substitute for an honest Task report.

Work metadata for hooks: optional `.agents/flow/prompt-log.config.json` (may be committed on a product branch) or gitignored `.agents/flow/local/prompt-log.json`:

```json
{ "work": "feature-intelligence", "stage": "Build" }
```

## Preference (post-install)

On the **first handled repository task** after Flow Factory install (or when neither opt-in nor decline is recorded):

1. End the response with one question (no option lists in the log question itself): **Enable local Q/A prompt logging to `prompts.txt`?**
2. **Yes** — add the [AGENTS.md enabled block](#agentsmd-enabled-block) to the repo agent entrypoint (`AGENTS.md` at the repository root, or `CLAUDE.md` / `.cursor/rules` when that file is the primary agent router for the checkout).
3. **No** — create `.agents/flow/local/prompt-log.declined` (gitignored) with one line: `declined: <ISO-8601>`. Do not ask again.

**Already decided:** Skip the question when `AGENTS.md` (or equivalent) contains `## Local prompt log (enabled)`, or when `prompt-log.declined` exists.

**Employer brief:** When a brief requires a prompt trail in Git, reconcile with [journal.md](journal.md) and [flow.md](../flow.md#starting-from-an-existing-brief). Use a **product branch** (for example `meta-cto`), track root `prompts.txt`, and keep assessment application code off `main`.

## When to append

| Condition | Append Q/A block |
| --- | --- |
| `## Local prompt log (enabled)` in agent entrypoint | **Required** each turn (hooks + coordinator) |
| Employer brief requires trail | **Required** (tracked or gitignored per brief) |
| Declined and no brief requirement | **Do not** append |
| Unset preference | **Do not** append until enabled; ask on first task |

Coordinator only. Workers and subagents never append.

**Default path:** repository-root `prompts.txt`. Use `.agents/flow/prompts.txt` only when the brief or enabled block says so.

## Q/A format

One block per handled human request. Log **questions and answers**, not multiple-choice option lists in **Q:**.

```text
---
Timestamp: <ISO-8601>
Work: <initiative slug or short id>
Stage: <Explore|Specify|Plan|Build|Review|Ship|setup|eval|flow-improve>
Generation: <cursor generation_id when appended by hook>

Human: <human message intent, redacted>

Agent: <concise outcome of this turn>

Q: <next question to the human, single line, no A/B/C options>

---
```

When the human’s message answers the prior **Q:**, start the block with **A:** on its own line before **Human:** or merge into **Human:** as “A: …”.

Redact secrets (tokens, keys, env secrets) before writing.

## Flow command metadata

The stop hook adds these lines only when the turn actually contains them:

| Line | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `Command:` | First token of the human text when it is a slash command such as `/flow` |
| `Skills:` | Names in a **Skills loaded** footer in the assistant transcript |
| `Model:` | A model identifier exposed on the hook payload (`model`, `model_id`, `modelId`) or transcript row |

Do not infer skills from the catalog. Do not invent a model id. Cursor transcripts observed in this repository expose `role`, `message`, `type`, and `status` only, so `Model:` stays absent unless the runtime adds one of those fields.

Subagent return reports live in separate transcripts. The parent stop hook does not receive them. Workers and subagents still must not append to `prompts.txt`. The hook does not write subagent metadata it did not observe. The coordinator records observed subagent outcomes in the Task report.

These commands do not enable the prompt log. Hooks still no-op unless `## Local prompt log (enabled)` is present. The stop hook remains the only automatic writer, so concurrent workers do not append the shared log.

Do not erase or rewrite earlier entries. Do not fabricate timestamps, commits, subagent work, or verification.

## AGENTS.md enabled block

Paste under the Flow section when the human opts in:

```markdown
## Local prompt log (enabled)

The coordinator **must** ensure repository-root `prompts.txt` receives one Q/A block per handled human request. Cursor hooks in `.cursor/hooks.json` append automatically when logging is enabled; the coordinator still reconciles summaries after delegated work. Format: [.agents/flow/operations/journal.md](.agents/flow/operations/journal.md#prompt-log-qa-format). Log **questions and answers** only—do not paste multiple-choice option lists into **Q:**. Default: gitignored local file; employer briefs may require a tracked log on a product branch only. Workers and subagents do not append.
```

## Extended journal block (optional)

For employer submissions that require richer metadata, append optional fields from [journal.md — Prompt log entry](journal.md#prompt-log-entry-coordinator-only) after the Q/A lines in the same block.
